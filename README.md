# CS3410-DAC-Piano

An embedded systems project conducted in Fall 2018 at MSU Denver for Professor Iliya Georgiev. 

This project was started and completed alongside my colleague, Phillip Sobczak.

The purpose of this project was to create a 4-bit DAC Piano using a breadboard and a Texas Instruments TM4C123GH6PM.
